**Delta Oscillations** \[[GitHub](https://github.com/tcwhalen/Whalen2020)\] \[[Paper](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jn.00158.2020)\]

An analysis of delta oscillations in Parkinson’s disease. A bit of novel signal processing to detect them and some statistical models to relate them to PD symptoms and understand how they propagate in the brain. Implemented in MATLAB and Python

**Pallidostriatal Microcircuit** \[[ModelDB](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/showmodel.cshtml?model=227577)\] \[[Paper](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/20/5556)\]

A biophysical model of the pallidostriatal microcircuit of the basal ganglia, suggesting its role in generating and propagating beta oscillations in Parkinson’s disease. Implemented in XPPAUT, a dynamical systems simulation tool, with analysis in MATLAB.

**Audio Classification** \[GitHub\] [Blog]

Inspired by signal processing ideas developed to detect neural oscillations, an investigation of how phase stationarity affords more accurate audio classification. Uses the public UrbanSound8K data set. Implemented in Python.
