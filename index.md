<img align="left" src="img/falls.png" alt="Swallow Falls State Park, MD" style="width:245px; margin: 5px 10px 10px 0px;"> I am a PhD candidate in Neural Computation at Carnegie Mellon University studying in the labs of Aryn Gittis (CMU Biology) and Jonathan Rubin (Pitt Mathematics).<br><br>Throughout my PhD, I've investigated the generation and propagation of pathological brain waves in Parkinsonâ€™s disease using electrophysiology and statistical and biophysical modeling techniques.<br><br>In my work as a computational neuroscientist, I aim to draw simple and meaningful conclusions about complex systems through the careful and clever analysis of data. I'm seeking to apply these skills to a wide range of challenging and impactful problems.
